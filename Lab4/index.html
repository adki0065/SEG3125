                            <p style="font-size:small;">Pets can be spayed or neutered once they reach 6 months of age. Recommended for all cats, dogs and rabbits. Spaying a pet entails surgical removal of the female reproductive tract, whereas neutering a male entails surgical
                                removal of the testicles. Spaying a female pet avoids the inconvenience of heat cycles, eliminates life-threatening infections of the uterus, and decreases the risk of breast cancer. Neutering a male pet decreases the incidence
                                of tumors of the anus, rectum, testicles, & prostate. Surgery may also decrease the tendency to stray or roam. Neutering a domestic rabbit can also decrease aggressive tendencies, biting, and thumping the hind feet.</p>

                                illustrate the functioning of internal organs and blood flow. Ultrasonography is non-invasive and provides us with an additional tool in the diagnosis and treatment of various medical conditions.</td>
